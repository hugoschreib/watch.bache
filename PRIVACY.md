# Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: February 5, 2026 Last Updated: February 5, 2026_

This Privacy Policy describes how _Bache_ handles information through our application(s) developed for Garmin devices.

## 1. Data Collection Philosophy

We believe in absolute privacy. Our Application is designed to function as a standalone tool on your Garmin device. We do not believe in tracking our users or harvesting their personal information.

## 2. No Collection of Personal Data

We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Data. "Personal Data" includes, but is not limited to:

- Name, email address, or contact information.
- Location data (GPS coordinates).
- Health and fitness metrics (heart rate, steps, sleep data).
- Device identifiers or IP addresses.

## 3. Activity Data

While the Application may access activity data provided by your Garmin device (such as speed, distance, or heart rate) to display it to you in real-time or to provide the Application’s core functionality, this data is never uploaded, stored on our servers, or shared with any third parties. Any processing of activity data occurs locally on your Garmin device and is volatile; it is cleared when the Application is closed or managed by the Garmin Connect system according to your personal Garmin privacy settings.

## 4. Third-Party Disclosure

Since we do not collect any user data, we do not—and cannot—sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties. We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking software.

## 5. Data Storage

The Application does not utilize any cloud storage or external databases. Any settings you save within the Application are stored locally on your Garmin device.

## 6. Compliance with Garmin Developer Terms

This policy is intended to comply with the Garmin Developer Program requirements regarding user transparency. Users are encouraged to also review the Garmin Privacy Policy to understand how Garmin handles data synced to Garmin Connect.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

## 8. Contact Information
